## Domains
Let's say you are developing a website for a multinational company, they probably want you to serve each nationality with its own content. In order to realize this, you have to add the client's content in multiple languages by using MODX's contexts. By using domains, you make sure that each visitor gets served with the right context. But how do you link the right domain to the right context?

To make this action easy, Oetzie introduced Domains: a free to use MODX Extra. This Extra lets you add domains and link them to a specific context. The linked context will be displayed when the domain gets requested.

## Features
* Domains gives you the possibility to link a specific domain to a specific context. 
* It also lets you set a homepage and 404 page for the linked context.
* Besides that, it lets you define a language per context.

## Workflow
1. Open up the Domains Extra from the gear wheel > Contexts > Domains.
2. Click the big green button to add a domain. 
3. Fill in the fields.
4. Save it. Done!

## Requirements
* MODX version 2.5.0 or newer has to be installed.
* The user needs to have the "domains" permissions.
